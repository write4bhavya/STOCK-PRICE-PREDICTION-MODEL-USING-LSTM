# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-LSTM
# üìà Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and PyTorch (with CUDA Support)

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical data and technical indicators through an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, implemented using PyTorch. The model is trained on normalized, time-sequenced data and optionally leverages GPU acceleration using CUDA for efficient computation.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Historical stock data retrieval using Yahoo Finance API
- Technical indicators: MACD, RSI, EMA, SMA
- LSTM-based deep learning model for time series forecasting
- CUDA/GPU acceleration (if available)
- Clean modular code structure for reusability
- Visualization of both training performance and forecasts
