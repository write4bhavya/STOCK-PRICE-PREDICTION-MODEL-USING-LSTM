# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-LSTM

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical data and technical indicators through an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, implemented using PyTorch. The model is trained on normalized, time-sequenced data and optionally leverages GPU acceleration using CUDA for efficient computation.

## üîç File Descriptions

### `data.py` and 'preprocess_data.py'
Handles all data-related operations:
- **`fetch_data()`**: Downloads historical stock price data using the `yfinance` API.
- **`compute_technical_indicators()`**: Computes popular technical indicators:
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
  - SMA (Simple Moving Average)
- **`preprocess_data()`**: 
  - Normalizes selected features using `MinMaxScaler`
  - Converts data into LSTM-compatible sequences (X, y)

---

### `model.py`
Defines the LSTM neural network architecture using PyTorch:
- **`LSTMmodel`**: 
  - Consists of one LSTM layer and one fully connected (linear) layer
  - Outputs a single predicted value for the next-day closing price

---

### `technical_indicators_plot.py`
Provides utility functions for data visualization:
- **`plot_technical_indicators()`**:
  - Plots the following technical indicators on subplots:
    - Closing Price
    - MACD & Signal Line
    - RSI
    - SMA and EMA

---

### `train.py`
Main execution script that orchestrates the end-to-end pipeline:
- Accepts user input (stock symbol, date range, interval)
- Fetches and visualizes historical data
- Computes indicators and preprocesses data
- Converts sequences to PyTorch tensors
- Initializes and trains the LSTM model using:
  - MSE loss (`nn.MSELoss`)
  - Adam optimizer (`torch.optim.Adam`)
- Generates 15-day forecast using recursive inference
- Visualizes:
  - Actual closing prices
  - Predicted prices on training data
  - 15-day forecast
- Calculates and prints the **R¬≤ score** as a performance metric
